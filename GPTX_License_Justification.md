# GPTX Licensing Strategy Justification

## Objective

The GPTX project is designed to be a decentralized and open-source initiative focused on AI token liquidity and sustainability. Our primary goals in choosing a license are to:

1. **Promote transparency and collaboration**
2. **Encourage community participation**
3. **Prevent early-stage commercial exploitation by third parties**
4. **Allow for future decentralization and full open licensing**

To meet these goals, we have adopted the **Business Source License (BSL) 1.1**.

## Why Business Source License 1.1?

BSL 1.1 offers a hybrid model that allows:

- ‚úÖ **Open access** to source code
- ‚úÖ **Freedom to view, audit, and contribute**
- üö´ **Restrictions on commercial use** until a future date (we chose January 1, 2028)
- üîì **Automatic transition to Apache 2.0**, a fully permissive open-source license, on the Change Date

This ensures that the project can be used for learning, research, and development while preventing for-profit companies from cloning or monetizing GPTX without contributing back to the ecosystem.

---

## Key Parameters

- **Change Date**: January 1, 2028
- **Change License**: Apache 2.0
- **License Scope**: All source code in this repository and related GPTX components

---

## Strategic Benefits

### üîê Protection from Misuse

By restricting commercial use during the formative years, GPTX can:
- Avoid being forked into closed-source clones
- Prevent premature monetization by centralized actors
- Retain core innovation within the community

### ü§ù Open Source Alignment

- Contributors can view, fork, and improve GPTX without legal risk
- Encourages collaboration, DAO formation, and governance discussions
- Provides transparency for grant programs and public-good funding initiatives

### üõ† Future-Proofing

After the **Change Date**, the project will convert to the Apache License 2.0:
- Fully permissive for all uses
- Maintains compatibility with Web3 and enterprise systems
- Aligns with long-term open decentralization goals

## Comparison to Other Licenses

| License     | Open? | Commercial Use? | Fork Protection | Transition Plan |
|-------------|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| MIT         | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ               | ‚ùå               | None             |
| GPLv3       | ‚úÖ     | Conditional      | ‚úÖ               | None             |
| SSPL        | ‚úÖ     | Very Restrictive | ‚úÖ               | None             |
| **BSL 1.1** | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå (until 2028)   | ‚úÖ               | Converts to Apache 2.0 |

---

## License Enforcement and Transparency

- A `LICENSE.md` file with full BSL 1.1 terms is included in each repository
- Commercial inquiries may be directed to: **founders@gptexchange.io**
- A `Green Ledger` and `Community DAO` will help oversee transitions and license scope decisions in future versions

---

## Summary

GPTX is committed to building a sustainable, transparent, and community-aligned AI infrastructure. By starting with BSL 1.1 and planning a clear transition to Apache 2.0, we ensure early protections without sacrificing long-term openness.
